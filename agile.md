AI-Driven Legal Document Analysis System


 1. Agile Model & Development Journey
1.1 Scrum Methodology Overview
Our development approach follows the Scrum Agile methodology, ensuring a structured yet flexible workflow for rapid development and continuous improvement. Key principles include:

✅ Iterative Development – Breaking the project into incremental sprints
✅ Fixed-Length Sprints – Two-week sprint cycles with clear goals and deliverables
✅ Daily Stand-ups – 15-minute daily syncs for progress updates and blockers
✅ Sprint Planning – Defining objectives at the start of each sprint
✅ Sprint Reviews – Demonstrating completed features to stakeholders
✅ Sprint Retrospectives – Analyzing and improving development processes
✅ Product Backlog – Maintaining a prioritized list of features and requirements

1.2 Development Phases
🚀 Our development journey follows a structured 5-phase approach:

1️⃣ Planning Phase

🔀 2. Version Control & CI/CD Setup
2.1 GitHub Version Control Strategy
📌 Branching Strateg

main (production) ←── develop ←── feature branches
    ↑                   ↑
release branches     hotfix branches

✅ Main Branch – Production-ready code, only merged from develop or hotfix branches
✅ Develop Branch – Integrates feature branches, regularly merged into main
✅ Feature Branches – For new features, merged into develop
✅ Hotfix Branches – Emergency fixes, merged into main and develop
✅ Release Branches – Stabilizing new releases before deployment

2.2 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
name: CI/CD Pipeline

📝 5. Code Overview & Functionality
5.1 Core Modules and Responsibilities


Main Application  
- File: app.py  
- Responsibility: Serves as the entry point, handling the Streamlit UI and navigation.

Document Analyzer  
- File: modules/document_analyzer.py  
- Responsibility: Extracts and processes text from uploaded documents using AI-powered text extraction.

Risk Analyzer  
- File: modules/risk_analyzer.py  
- Responsibility: Identifies potential legal risks and assigns risk scores based on document content.

Compliance Checker  
- File: modules/compliance_checker.py  
- Responsibility: Verifies adherence to relevant legal frameworks and compliance standards.

Document Comparer
